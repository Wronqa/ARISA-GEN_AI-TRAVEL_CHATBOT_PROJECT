  "Q: What identification is needed for domestic flights within a country? A: While requirements vary, a government-issued photo ID (like a national ID card or driver's license) is usually sufficient for domestic flights *within* most countries (e.g., within the Schengen Area or the US). However, carrying your passport is always the most reliable option and may be required by specific airlines or countries. Always double-check airline requirements before travel.",
  "Q: What's the recommended airport arrival time for international travel? A: We strongly advise arriving at the airport *at least 3 hours* before your scheduled international flight departure. During peak seasons or at major international hubs, allowing 3.5-4 hours can reduce stress and account for longer queues at check-in, baggage drop, and security.",
  "Q: How do I know if I need a visa for my destination? A: Visa requirements depend heavily on your nationality and the destination country's regulations. While we provide basic guidance during booking, *it is ultimately the traveller's responsibility* to verify exact requirements and obtain necessary visas through the destination country's official embassy or consulate website well in advance of departure.",
  "Q: How long does my passport need to be valid for international travel? A: Most countries require your passport to be valid for *at least 6 months beyond your intended departure date* from that country. Some may have shorter requirements, but the 6-month rule is the safest standard to follow. Always check the specific entry requirements for your destination.",
  "Q: What is the standard baggage allowance for checked luggage? A: Checked baggage allowances vary significantly by airline, route, and ticket class (Economy, Business, etc.). Common allowances range from 15kg to 32kg per piece, often with limits on the number of pieces. Always check your specific airline's policy or your e-ticket details.",
  "Q: What are the typical size and weight limits for carry-on luggage? A: Carry-on limits also vary greatly. Typical size restrictions are around 55x40x23 cm (22x16x9 inches), and weight limits often range from 7kg to 12kg. Many airlines also allow one smaller personal item (like a laptop bag or handbag). Check your airline's specific rules.",
  "Q: What are the rules for carrying liquids in carry-on baggage? A: Generally, liquids, aerosols, and gels must be in containers of 100ml (3.4oz) or less.

Exceptions usually apply for baby food/milk and essential medicines (proof may be required).",
  "Q: Can I check-in online for my flight? A: Most airlines offer online check-in, typically opening 24-48 hours before departure. This allows you to confirm your seat and get your boarding pass digitally or print it. If checking bags, you'll still need to visit the bag drop counter at the airport.",
  "Q: What happens if my flight is delayed or cancelled? A: Airline policies vary based on the length of delay and reason (e.g., weather, technical). Depending on the situation and regulations (like EU261), you may be entitled to assistance (meals, accommodation), rebooking on the next available flight, or a refund. Contact the airline directly at the airport for assistance.",
  "Q: What is a connecting flight / layover? A: A connecting flight means you'll change planes at an intermediate airport (the layover point) before reaching your final destination. Ensure you have enough layover time (minimum 1.5-2 hours usually recommended, more for international connections) to transfer between gates and potentially clear security/immigration again.",
  "Q: Do I need to collect my checked luggage during a layover? A: Usually, for connections on the same airline or partner airlines booked on a single ticket, your luggage will be checked through to your final destination. However, if entering a new country (like the US), you often need to collect bags, clear customs, and re-check them. Always confirm with the airline at check-in.",
  "Q: What is a Schengen Visa and who needs one? A: A Schengen Visa allows travel within the Schengen Area (comprising 27 European countries) for tourism or business for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Whether you need one depends on your nationality. Citizens of many countries (e.g., US, Canada, Australia) can enter visa-free for short stays.",
  "Q: What should I do if I lose my passport while traveling? A: Report the loss immediately to the local police to get a police report. Then, contact your country's embassy or consulate in the destination country. They can assist you in obtaining emergency travel documents to return home.",

Detailed terms and conditions are provided during the booking process and outlined in your booking confirmation. Cancellation fees typically increase closer to the departure date. We highly recommend purchasing travel insurance.",
  "Q: Can I make changes to my booking after it's confirmed? A: Changes may be possible, but they are often subject to availability and may incur amendment fees from both our agency and suppliers (airlines, hotels). Name changes are often treated as cancellations and rebookings, potentially incurring significant costs. Please contact us as soon as possible if you need to make changes.",

  "Q: Does travel insurance cover pre-existing medical conditions? A: Coverage for pre-existing conditions varies significantly between policies. Some may offer cover if the condition is stable, others require declaring it (potentially at extra cost), and some exclude it entirely. Read the policy wording carefully or ask us for policies that offer this cover.",
  "Q: When should I purchase travel insurance? A: We recommend purchasing travel insurance as soon as you book your trip (i.e., pay your deposit). This ensures you are covered for cancellation benefits if something unexpected happens *before* your departure.",
  "Q: How do I make a claim on my travel insurance? A: In an emergency, contact the insurance provider's 24/7 assistance line immediately. For non-emergency claims (e.g., lost baggage, cancellation), you'll typically need to complete a claim form and provide supporting documents (receipts, police reports, medical certificates) after your trip. Keep all relevant paperwork.",
  "Q: Are vaccinations required for my trip? A: Vaccination requirements depend on the destination, your country of origin, and your personal health history.

Prevention involves gradual acclimatization (ascending slowly, rest days), staying hydrated (avoid alcohol), and potentially preventative medication prescribed by your doctor.",
  "Q: What should I pack for my trip? A: Packing depends greatly on your destination's climate, the duration of your trip, and planned activities. General recommendations include comfortable walking shoes, layered clothing, necessary medications (with prescription if needed), travel adapters, sunscreen, insect repellent (if applicable), and copies of important documents.",
  "Q: Do I need a travel adapter or voltage converter? A: Maybe. Electrical outlets and voltage vary worldwide. Research the plug type and voltage of your destination(s).

Research local tipping customs.",
  "Q: Should I exchange currency before I leave or at my destination? A: It's often best to get a small amount of local currency before you leave for immediate expenses (taxi, snacks). You usually get better exchange rates by withdrawing cash from local ATMs upon arrival or exchanging at reputable banks/exchange bureaus in the destination, rather than at airport counters or your home bank.",
  "Q: How do I inform my bank about my travel plans? A: Most banks allow you to set up a travel notification online through their website or mobile app. You can also call their customer service line. This helps prevent your cards from being blocked due to suspicion of fraudulent activity when used abroad.",

  "Q: What type of accommodation can I expect? A: Accommodation styles vary per trip, ranging from comfortable 3-star hotels to luxury 5-star resorts, boutique hotels, traditional guesthouses (like Riads or Ryokans), eco-lodges, or even unique stays like desert camps or cruise ships. The specific standard (e.g., '4-Star Hotels') is mentioned in each offer.",

  "Q: What is a 'single supplement'? A: Tour prices are usually based on two people sharing a room (per person, double occupancy).

Ask your hotel to call a reputable taxi if needed.",
  "Q: What are the key differences between a guided tour and independent travel?
